# Outline for deletion analysis

## 1
# Performing the survival analysis for 40 deletion-tagging variants for 
# recipients only according to the script:
# "Survival_analysis_for_deletions_recipients_only.R"
# Here the coding for the deletion-tagging variants is:
# 1 = homozygous for major allele or heterozygous
# 2 = homozygous for minor allele

## 2
# Creating the files for deletion mismatch analysis according to the script:
# "Create_covariate_files_for_all_deletions_before_genomic_collision.R"
# Here the previous coding for deletion-tagging variants are recoded accordingly:
# 0 = homozygous for major allele or heterozygous
# 1 = homozygous for minor allele

## 3
# Performing the survival analysis for deletion mismatch for 40 deletion-tagging variants
# between donor and recipient ("genomic collision") according to the script:
# "Survival_analysis_for_deletions_mismatch.R"
# Here, the mismatch (value 1) comes when patient is 1 (homozygous for minor allele) and donor is 0 
# (heterozygous or homozygous for major allele)

## 4
# Calculating the sum of all deletions among recipient data according to the script:
# "All_deletions_sum_recipients.R"

## 5
# Calculating the sum of deletion mismatches between donor and recipient
# according to the script:
# "All_deletions_sum_mismatch.R"
